=============================
This project was designed to simply monitor two sensors for moisture connected to an Arduino. The code here needs to updating.

Some assistance would be greatly appreciated in figuring out why the code doesn't work with both the TFT display AND the Xively feed communication.

The sensors (two moisture sensors, a DHT11, and a Photoresistor) read properly without issues and are simply added to a breadboard. Available almost anywhere and any Radio Shack.
